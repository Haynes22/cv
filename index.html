          I am a full time mom to two boys and looking to start a career of my own. I
          completed some school at <strong><a href=" https://www.sunyocc.edu/students">Onondaga Community College</a></strong>for nursing but through my own
          research, I found an interest in web development. With web development being in such high demand and my own
          personal business goals and ideas, this job transition seemed like a "no-brainer". I have found coding to be very challenging,
          yet fun. I'm looking forward to seeing all the things I can accomplish.
